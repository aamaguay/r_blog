  description: "This research aimed to predict the chemical compounds of cocoa through machine learning algorithms, using data from leaves and almonds. Near-infrared devices were used to determine the values of the chemical compounds, and were considered as ground truths to carry out predictions. In addition, the XGBoost, Random Forest, OLS Regression, and SVRegression algorithms were used in this research. Results were compared with the Principal Component Regression models to evaluate the performance of the approaches."

  description: "This research is currently being conducted; it aims to determine which metrics had a significant influence regarding the impact that villages suffer during an earthquake. I used socioeconomic variables, such as mobile coverage, education, poverty level, and migration rate. I also estimated the resiliency and concentration indicator using Call Detail Records (CDR) data. Finally, I propose developing an econometric model that associates the number of affected households with the socioeconomic and CDR variables."
