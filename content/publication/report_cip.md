abstract: The Galapagos Islands are internationally recognized as a world-class tourist destination; however, little research has been done on the economic dynamism that tourism activities generate at the local and national levels. This research is based on secondary information from official institutions, and primary information that included interviews with cruise ship representatives and experts, taking 2019 as the year of analysis, since 2020 presents an atypical dynamic due to the Covid-19 pandemic. To identify the economic contribution of cruise ships, we began with an analysis of the economic contribution of the tourism industry at the national level and, in particular, in the Galapagos archipelago, followed by a projection of the economic contribution of cruise ship tourism to the Galapagos Islands and, finally, an estimate of the economic dynamics generated by cruise ship tourism on the mainland.
