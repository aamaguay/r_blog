abstract: Information has always been a potential source of comparative advantage between companies, so knowing it in its entirety  has  become  a  necessity  for  decision  makers.  Today,  there  are  tools  such  as  Social  Network  Analysis, which  may  have  a  greater  scope  to  know  the  impact  of  relationships  between  individuals.  In  this  project,  the effect  of  financial  performance  on  sharing  human  capital  and  being  a  prominent  company  in  the  market  is quantified.  Likewise,  communities  in  the  industry  were  identified,  using  modularity  as  a  measure  of  grouping between companies. With a sample of 9,070 signatures from Ecuador in 2018, indicators were proposed based on  the  history  of  administrators  and  the  centrality  measures  of  the  graph  theory.  Income  was  chosen  as  the indicator  that  best  represents  financial  performance.  The  results  found  showed  that  there  is  a  considerable positive  effect  on  financial  performance  when  a  company  is  prominent  in  the  market.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is determined  that  there  is  a  negative  effect  on  financial  performance  by  sharing  human  capital,  when  hiring  a worker  who  works  or  worked  in  a  company  in  the  same  sector,  as  well  as  in  other  sectors  of  the  industry. Finally, it was found that the indicators that quantify connections with companies represent avaluable source of information for firms.
